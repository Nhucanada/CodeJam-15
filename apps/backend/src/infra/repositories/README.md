# infra/repositories

This folder contains repository modules responsible for long-term storage and retrieval of process execution data. These repositories provide a data access layer that enables persistent and structured collection of operational or analytic events, outcomes, and other execution-related records. The stored data support future analytics, reporting, and auditing use cases across the system.
